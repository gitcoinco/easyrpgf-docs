# EasyRPGF Overview

Welcome to [EasyRPGF](https://easyretropgf.xyz/) (Retroactive Public Goods Funding), the lowest-barrier tool for Retroactive funding.\
\
Retroactive funding is funding for communities and initiatives based on _past_ indicators - [**itâ€™s easier to agree on what **_**was**_** useful than what **_**will be**_** useful**.](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c)

An EasyRetroFunding round has three members:

1. Round Manager
   * Creates a round, reviews applications, tallies results, distributes funding
2. Applicant
   * Represents an eligible project seeking funding
3. Voter
   * Community member entrusted to vote on worthy applications

EasyRPGF is built on Gitcoin's [Allo](https://allo.gitcoin.co/) protocol, a set of common tools enabling simple funding allocation and distribution for grants initiatives.

This app is made possible by the [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) team and is committed to [open source](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf) values. You are free to clone, modify, or self-host this service.
