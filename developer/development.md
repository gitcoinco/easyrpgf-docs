# Development

EasyRetroPGF is built on Gitcoin's Allo protocol.

This protocol also powers the full-blown [Grants Stack](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack) platform for [creating/managing](https://manager.gitcoin.co), [applying](https://builder.gitcoin.co/), and [donating](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/) to grant rounds and public funding initiatives.

EasyRetroPGF uses Allo to process and handle token distribution. More information on Allo can be found in the [docs](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/), with code and contract addresses available in the [open source repo](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2).

#### Developing

EasyRetroPGF is [open source](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf) and can be readily contributed to. Users are encouraged to open Github issues, reach out in the [Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin), or fork the repo to implement their own modifications.
