# Self-Hosting

As an open source project, users are welcome to view EasyRetroPGF's [source code](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf) and deploy their own instance of the app.

The [Setup Guide](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf/blob/main/docs/01\_setup.md) makes it simple to get the service up and running yourself (most readily using Vercel). It is by no means required to deploy the service yourself - the publicly hosted site is available free and without ask.

Issues, clarifying questions, or feedback are welcome - please direct them to the source [Github repo](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf/issues) or the [Gitcoin Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gitcoin).
