# Applications

Reviewing applications is an important part of a successful round. Admins review applications for suitability/eligibility to ensure only appropriate submissions are voted on.

While most of the application form is generalized across rounds, **Impact Categories** should be set during round creation reflecting any unique criteria.

#### Application Period (Registration)

When applications open, they will become visible in the round's admin dashboard. It is typical for many applications to be submitted near the deadline - it's prudent to allow yourself sufficient time to review applications before the start of the voting period.

Application approval generates an onchain transaction. Applications not approved will continue to sit in the application queue.

#### Revoking

A previously approved application can later be revoked - this requires an onchain transaction from the same admin that generated the approval. It will be returned to the pending state.
