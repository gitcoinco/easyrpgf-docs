# Round Creation

Creating a round is simple. Begin with connecting a wallet:

Then start the `+ New round` process to name your round and configure round details.

#### Round details

Provide a name, graphic, and description for your round. Define the "**Impact Categories**" that will be used to evaluate applications (ideally measurable). You will also get your **Round URL** here.

#### Round phases

Determine start and end dates for applications and voting, as well as the final payout date.\
**Tip**: provide some time (e.g. 2 days) between the Review and Voting periods to allow your team sufficient time to review applications.

#### Network & Token

Select from the list of supported networks, and provide the intended funding token's address in the token field. Several testnets are available.\
Additionally, use the "Configure Pool" section to register, create, and fund the onchain "pool" containing the funds for your round. EasyRPGF is built on Gitcoin's [Allo Protocol](https://allo.gitcoin.co/).

#### Admin accounts

Add or remove admin addresses. These addresses will have the same permissions as the round creator, and are able to edit round info or review applications.

#### Voters

Voting participants are white-listed by the provided addresses. Settings determining maximum votes are also determined here. Maximums exist to avoid any one project from being overrepresented in the final tally.

#### Applications

[Review](applications.md), approve, and deny applications from this screen. Changes to applications can take up to 10 minutes to be reflected.

#### Distribute

At the end of a round, and with the Allo pool configured/funded, tally the votes and begin the distribution of funds to eligible projects.
