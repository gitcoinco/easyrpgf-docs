# Applying to a Round

After a round has been created, they can reached from their Round URL. Applications to the round can begin once the Registration period starts.

* Click "+ Apply with your project" to open the new application page.
* Fill out the application to the best of your ability. Take your time, as the information may not be able to be changed later.
  * Avoid personal or overly sensitive information in your application; your answers are not confidential.
  * "Payout address" should be a secure wallet in control of your project. It will autopopulate with the address of the currently connected wallet.
* Click "Create application" to produce and sign a transaction finalizing your application to the round.

Once applied, an admin will have to manually review your submission for it to be eligible for funding.
